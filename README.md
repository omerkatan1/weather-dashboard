# weather-dashboard

## functionality
* The user will first see an empty website
* The search button will take a city input and the output will be the current weather for that city
    * It will also give you a five-day forcast
* Buttons will be dynamically created so that the user will be able to click a button on a saved city, rather than retyping the city again.
